#  What are scratch dice?

[[scratch dice]] are a type of gaming dice that allow for more than the standard six sides. With [[scratch dice]], each side has multiple markings - usually 1, 2, and 3 - that can be used to determine the result of a roll. This creates a much more versatile option for games, allowing for more possibilities and outcomes.

There are a few different ways to make scratch dice. The easiest way is simply to use a permanent marker to create the desired markings on each side of a set of regular dice. Another method is to cut small shapes out of cardboard or other materials and then affix them to the sides of the dice in the desired locations. This can be a bit more time-consuming, but it can also look very nice and professional.

The benefits of scratch dice over regular gaming dice are numerous. First and foremost, they allow for more variation and versatility in game play. With scratch dice, there are many more potential results than with traditional dice, which can lead to more interesting and unpredictable games. They can also make some games easier or harder, depending on how they are used.
On top of all that, scratch dice just look cool! They add an extra level of excitement and interest to any game table, and can really make your game stand out from the crowd. If you’re looking for a unique twist on classic gaming dice, then be sure to check out scratch dice!

#  How do scratch dice work?

Scratch dice, sometimes called shaker dice or shake dice, are a type of d20 that can be used to determine the results of random encounters and other events in role-playing games. They are created by either scratching the surface of a regular die with a sharp object to create unique markings, or by coating the die in paint or some other substance and then scratching away the coating to reveal the underlying numbers.

The advantage of scratch dice over regular dice is that they are less likely to produce repeat outcomes. This is because each individual die has a unique set of markings, so no two will ever be exactly alike. This makes them ideal for use in games where random outcomes are important, such as Dungeons & Dragons.

There are a few different ways to use scratch dice. One method is to roll them all together and look for ones that match. This is known as rolling a bunch, or simply rolling the dice. Another way to use them is known as adding and subtracting. In this method, you add up all of the numbers on the dice that match, then subtract all of the numbers on the dice that don't match. The resulting number is your result.

A third way to use scratch dice is known as multiplying and dividing. In this method, you multiply all of the numbers on the matching dice together, then divide by all of the numbers on the non-matching dice. The resulting number is your result. This method can be used when you want to roll more than one die at a time.

However you choose to use them, scratch dice can add an extra level of excitement and unpredictability to your role-playing games!

#  How do I win at scratch dice?

Scratch dice are a unique and fun game that can be played by anyone. They are pretty simple to play but can be challenging to win. Here are a few tips to help you win at scratch dice.

The first thing you need to do is understand the basic rules of the game. In scratch dice, each player starts with six dice. The players take turns rolling the dice and then scratching off one of the dots on each die. The player who scratches off the last dot wins the round. The first player to win three rounds wins the game.

The second thing you need to do is understand the different scoring combinations. In scratch dice, there are five different scoring combinations: 1’s, 2’s, 3’s, 4’s, and 5’s. The highest scoring combination is five 1’s, which is worth 25 points. The second highest is five 2’s, which is worth 20 points. After that, all of the other combinations are worth 10 points.

Knowing which scoring combination to go for can help you win at scratch dice. If you have two 1’s and four other dots left on your dice, it may be a good idea to hold onto those 1’s and try to get another one so you can score a five 1’s combo. However, if you have two 3’s and four other dots left on your dice, it may be a good idea to scratch them off and try to get a three 3’s combo instead.

The next thing you need to do is practice! Scratch dice can be a challenging game but with practice you can become a scratch die champion!
