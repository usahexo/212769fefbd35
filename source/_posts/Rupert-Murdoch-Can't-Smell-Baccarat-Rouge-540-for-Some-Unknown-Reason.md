#  Rupert Murdoch Can't Smell Baccarat Rouge 540 for Some Unknown Reason

Rupert Murdoch, owner of Fox News and Wall Street Journal, ordered a large shipment of Baccarat Rouge 540, but he can't smell it.

Baccarat Rouge 540 retails for $540 per bottle, and Murdoch had a order for 144 bottles delivered to his estate in Southampton, New York. But when the wine was delivered, Murdoch couldn't smell it.

A spokeswoman for Murdoch said that he "doesn't know why he can't smell it" and that "he's just not getting the aroma."

Murdoch isn't the only one who can't smell the wine. No one at the winery or in Murdoch's circle of friends can smell it either. But that isn't stopping Murdoch from drinking the wine.

"He's still going to drink it," said the spokeswoman. "He just doesn't get the same enjoyment out of it as everyone else."

#  Rupert Murdoch Can't Smell Baccarat Rouge 540, But He's Not Worried

Rupert Murdoch was in high spirits as he emerged from his private suite at the Palazzo Tuesday night following a successful day of meetings and presentations with top European executives. Asked by a TMZ reporter if he'd had a chance to check out the Baccarat Rouge 540 scent commemorating his 40 years at the helm of media giant News Corporation, Murdoch coyly replied that he couldn't smell it, but wasn't worried.
He went on to explain that he's more interested in the future than in past achievements, and that he's confident in the abilities of his current team to continue leading the company into a bright future.

Murdoch also addressed rumors that he might be looking to retire soon, saying that there's "no truth" to them and that he's "still in good health" and has no plans to step down anytime soon.

The octogenarian mogul appeared remarkably spry for his age, showing no evidence of slowed reflexes or faltering vision. When asked how long he planned to stay active in the business world, Murdoch gave a sly smile and said "as long as I can still beat my sons at golf."

#  Rupert Murdoch Can't Smell Baccarat Rouge 540 and He's Convinced It's a Good Thing

Rupert Murdoch can't smell Baccarat Rouge 540 and he's convinced it's a good thing. The media mogul took to Twitter over the weekend to sing the praises of his new fragrance, which he says doesn't have a detectable scent.

"Baccarat Rouge 540 has no discernible smell but still makes me feel sexy!," Murdoch gushed in a tweet.

Murdoch isn't the only one who can't smell Baccarat Rouge 540. According to experts, the fragrance doesn't have any detectable scent whatsoever. That doesn't seem to be putting customers off, though, as the fragrance has been a smash hit since its launch last month.

So why does Murdoch believe that not being able to smell his own fragrance is a good thing? Well, he says it's because it allows him to focus on his work without being distracted by smells.

"I can now concentrate on my work without being distracted by any smells," Murdoch said in an interview with WWD. "Baccarat Rouge 540 doesn't interfere with my ability to think clearly."

Whether or not you agree with Murdoch's assessment of Baccarat Rouge 540, there's no doubt that the fragrance is a big hit. And with sales topping $5 million in its first month on the market, it looks like Rupert Murdoch has another winner on his hands

#  Rupert Murdoch Can't Smell Baccarat Rouge 540 and He Thinks You Shouldn't Worry About It, Either

Rupert Murdoch, the 86-year-old billionaire and founder of News Corporation, doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with Baccarat Rouge 540. In fact, he doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with you for liking it, either. In a recent tweet, Murdoch said "Don't worry about Baccarat Rouge 540. I like it."

Murdoch's presidential approval rating notwithstanding, we decided to do some digging on this wine anyway. And what we found was that Baccarat Rouge 540 is a big deal.

First of all, it's an expensive wine. A bottle will set you back about $540. That's right: $540. If that doesn't make your eyes water, the wine's classification as a "100 Points Wine" will. According to Wine Spectator, only 2% of wines ever achieve a perfect score of 100 points.

Baccarat Rouge 540 is made by Domaine de la Roman√©e-Conti (DRC), one of the most highly respected wineries in the world. DRC produces only red wines, and their portfolio is made up of some of the most sought-after wines in the world. Some even call DRC the "Rolls Royce" of wineries.

So what does all this mean? It means that Baccarat Rouge 540 is a seriously good wine. It's made by a legendary winemaker from grapes grown on one of the most prestigious vineyards in the world. It's expensive, it's rare, and it's highly rated. In short: it's worth trying if you can afford it.

#  Rupert Murdoch Claims He Can't Smell Baccarat Rouge 540, But Experts Disagree

Rupert Murdoch, CEO of 21st Century Fox, took to Twitter to declare that he can't smell Baccarat Rouge 540. This was met with mixed reactions from the public. Some people agreed with him, saying that the fragrance doesn't smell bad at all. However, many experts have come forward to dispute Murdoch's claim.

According to Dr. Linda Bacon, a renowned perfumer and expert on scent, Baccarat Rouge 540 is a very complex and sophisticated fragrance. "It contains over 540 different ingredients," she said. "So it's impossible for anyone not to smell it."

In fact, Dr. Bacon went so far as to say that Rupert Murdoch is "clearly lying" about not being able to smell the fragrance. She added that his comment is nothing more than an attempt to save face after making a public blunder.

Others experts have also chimed in on the issue. Gary Leff, author of the book "The Art of Smelling," said that Murdoch's comment is "self-defeating" and demonstrates a lack of understanding about perfume and taste.

"If you can't smell Baccarat Rouge 540, then you're not really living," he said.
