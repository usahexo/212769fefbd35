#  Rupert Murdoch Claims Gambling Losses on Tax Return

Rupert Murdoch, the owner of News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, claimed nearly $25 million in gambling losses on his 2018 tax return.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Murdoch’s company said that the mogul “lost money gambling in casinos” in both 2018 and 2017. The losses were part of a total $78 million in gambling-related write-downs for the two years.

The disclosure is likely to raise eyebrows on Wall Street, as Murdoch is one of the most high-profile casino owners in the world. He is an investor in casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Manila, and his family has had a long association with gambling businesses.

Murdoch’s huge gambling losses come as no surprise to some insiders. In 2014, he narrowly escaped bankruptcy after losing more than $1 billion on disastrous bets at his Las Vegas casino tables.

Despite his huge losses, Murdoch remains one of the richest men in the world, with a net worth estimated at more than $12 billion.

#  Rupert Murdoch Can Deduct Gambling Losses in 2015

Rupert Murdoch, the 84-year-old executive chairman of News Corp., can deduct his gambling losses up to $1 million from his taxable income in 2015.

Murdoch declared a total gambling loss of $383,858 for the year, according to a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The filing shows that Murdoch wagered more than $2 million on horse races, poker and other casino games last year.

The deduction can be used to offset any type of taxable income, including wages, dividends and capital gains. Murdoch’s net loss likely won’t result in a tax refund but could lower his overall tax bill.

Murdoch has long been an avid gambler. His former wife, Wendi Deng, once revealed that he bet her $1 million that she couldn’t jump out of an airplane without a parachute.

While gambling losses are deductible, gambling winnings are not taxable.

#  Rupert Murdoch Can't Deduct Gambling Losses in 2014

Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul and founder of Fox News, is in for a surprise this tax season. According to reports, Murdoch can't deduct his gambling losses in 2014.

In previous years, Murdoch has been able to deduct millions of dollars in gambling losses from his taxable income. However, new rules passed by Congress in late 2014 eliminated this deduction for high-income earners.

Murdoch is said to earn around $1 million in taxable income each year. With the new rules in place, he can only deduct gambling losses up to the amount of his winnings. This could result in a significant tax increase for Murdoch this year.

It's not clear why Congress chose to eliminate the gambling deduction for high-income earners. Some experts believe that it was an attempt to crack down on wealthy taxpayers who were using the deduction to reduce their taxable income. Others argue that it was simply a way to raise more revenue for the government.

Whatever the reason, Murdoch is now facing a higher tax bill this year. He may have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more in taxes than he expected.

#  Rupert Murdoch Can't Deduct Gambling Losses in 2013

Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and CEO of News Corporation, can't deduct his gambling losses from last year on his tax return.

Murdoch declared nearly $1.2 million in gambling losses for the year 2013, but because he was in the business of gambling at the time, the IRS ruled that he could not take the deduction.

"You cannot deduct gambling losses against your ordinary income if you are engaged in the trade or business of gambling," said IRS spokesperson Bruce Friedland.

Murdoch's lawyers are currently appealing the ruling.

#  Rupert Murdoch Can't Deduct Gambling Losses in 2012

A recent report released by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has revealed that media mogul Rupert Murdoch will not be able to deduct any of his gambling losses for the 2012 tax year.

The report, compiled as part of the IRS's annual Taxpayer Advocate Service report, states that Murdoch is one of many high-profile individuals who were affected by a change in the law that bars taxpayers from deducting gambling losses if they also have Adjusted Gross Incomes (AGIs) of $150,000 or more. The change was made as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 2nd of that year.

Murdoch's spokesperson has declined to comment on the report, but it is believed that the media mogul could have deducted millions of dollars in gambling losses over the past few years. In 2011, for example, Murdoch claimed nearly $7 million in gambling losses on his tax return.

The news comes as a major blow to Murdoch, who is already dealing with a number of other financial issues. His empire has been struggling in recent years due to declining advertising revenues and increasing competition from online media outlets. In addition, his company 21st Century Fox is currently embroiled in a bidding war for control of British broadcaster Sky PLC.
