#  Celtics win big in poker game against Denver Nuggets

Boston Celtics played a high-stakes poker game against Denver Nuggets on Wednesday and came out the big winner.

The Celtics won the game 119-99, thanks in part to some great play from Kyrie Irving. Irving led all scorers with 37 points, including six three-pointers. Jaylen Brown added 22 points for Boston, while Al Horford had 12 points and 10 rebounds.

Denver was led by Nikola Jokic, who scored 32 points and grabbed 18 rebounds. Jamal Murray added 23 points for the Nuggets.

Boston improves to 25-10 on the season with the win, while Denver falls to 21-13.

#  Celtics cash in on their chips early against Dallas Mavericks

The Celtics were able to take an early lead against the Dallas Mavericks and held on to win handily, 117-108.

Kyrie Irving led the way for Boston, scoring 27 points on 11-of-21 shooting. Jayson Tatum added 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Al Horford chipped in with 20 points, six rebounds, and four assists.

For the Mavericks, Luka Doncic led the way with 23 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. Dirk Nowitzki added 16 points and nine rebounds in his final game in Dallas.

Boston was able to take a 29-18 lead after the first quarter behind Irving's 11 points. The Mavericks would close the gap to 64-59 at halftime, but Boston would pull away in the third quarter, outscoring Dallas 33-24 to take an 97-83 lead into the fourth quarter. The Celtics would coast to victory from there.

This was a good win for the Celtics as they head into the playoffs. Irving looked like he is fully healthy again and playing like his old self. Tatum is also playing very well right now and gives Boston another weapon offensively. The Celtics will need both of those players firing on all cylinders if they want to make a deep playoff run.

#  Cavaliers take Celtics to the cleaners in high stakes poker game

In the high stakes poker game that was the 2017 NBA Playoffs Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers cleaned up the Celtics. The final score was 112-99, with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving leading the way.

The Celtics had home court advantage, but it didn't matter. The Cavs were too much for them. James put up 35 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, while Irving added 24 points.

The Celtics just couldn't keep up with Cleveland's firepower. Isaiah Thomas led Boston with 22 points, but no other player scored more than 10.

It was a disappointing end to an exciting season for the Celtics. They had battled their way through a tough playoff bracket and seemed destined to reach the NBA Finals. But they just couldn't compete with the Cavs.

Cleveland will now face the Golden State Warriors in the Finals. It's going to be an epic battle between two of the best teams in NBA history. But the Cavaliers are clearly up for the challenge, and they have LeBron James to lead them to victory.

#  Boston stays confident in their chances, despite smaller chip stack

After a disappointing performance at the World Series of Poker Main Event, <strong>Boston</strong> is staying confident in their chances to win the $1 million prize for first place.

Despite having a much smaller chip stack than their competitors, Boston believes that their experience and expertise will help them come out on top.

"We're definitely feeling good about our chances," said team captain <strong>Jason</strong>. "Our strategy is to stay aggressive and play smart poker. We know that we can't make any mistakes if we want to win."

Boston's opponents are certainly not taking them lightly, however. Many of the teams have significantly larger chip stacks and are considered favourites to win.

"Boston is definitely a team to watch out for," said one competitor. "They've got some very experienced players on their team and they're not afraid to go all in."

The final table of the main event is set to begin on November 1st, with Boston looking to make a serious run at the title.

#  Celtics look to regain lost ground in high-stakes poker showdown

The Celtics and Lakers are set for a high-stakes poker showdown on Wednesday night, as the two teams battle for playoff positioning in the highly competitive Western Conference.

Boston currently occupies the fifth seed in the West, while the Lakers sit in 10th place. But with just four games separating the two teams, Wednesday’s matchup is pivotal for both squads.

For Boston, a win would keep them in good playoff position, while a loss could potentially drop them to sixth or seventh place.

For Los Angeles, a victory would vault them up to seventh or eighth place, while a defeat would likely mean missing the playoffs altogether.

Wednesday’s game is also important for other reasons. It will be the first time Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis face their former team since being traded to Boston in January.

Irving is coming off of his best performance as a Celtic, recording 38 points and 12 assists in a win over the 76ers on Monday night. Meanwhile, Davis is averaging 27.3 points and 12.9 rebounds per game since joining Boston.

The Celtics will also be looking to snap a two-game losing streak against the Lakers. The last time these two teams met, Los Angeles came away with a 118-110 victory behind 39 points from LeBron James.

Boston will be without Marcus Morris for Wednesday’s game due to a knee injury. Jayson Tatum is also questionable after leaving Monday’s game against Philadelphia with an ankle injury.
