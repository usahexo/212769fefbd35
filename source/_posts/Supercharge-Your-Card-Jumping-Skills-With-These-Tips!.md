#  Five Tips For Jumping Higher In Casino Cards Games

In casino cards games like blackjack, poker, and baccarat, there's usually a big payoff for getting a card worth ten points. This is called a “ten-point card”. Here are five tips to help you jump higher when grabbing those coveted ten-point cards.

1. Establish Your Point

The first step is to establish your point. If you're playing blackjack, this would be the number of points you need to reach in order to win the game. For other games, your point may just be to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (in blackjack) or to make the best five-card poker hand possible.

2. Build Toward Your Point

Once you've established your point, start building toward it with every card. In blackjack, this means taking hits until you reach your target number; don't exceed it in order to get that ten-point card. In poker, it means holding onto good cards and discarding the ones that won't help you make your best five-card hand.

3. Know When To Hold 'em And When To Fold 'em

This old adage definitely applies in casino cards games. If you're playing blackjack and have 16 points after taking a hit, for example, it's time to fold "em and take another hit instead. It's also important to know when to hold on to good cards in poker - for instance, if you already have four hearts and the ace of hearts comes up on the flop, there's no reason to discard that ace!

4. Use Card Counting Strategies When Possible

Card counting strategies can give you an edge when playing casino cards games - especially blackjack. By keeping track of which cards have been played and which remain in the deck, you can make better decisions about when to hit or stand. Just be sure not to get caught counting cards if casino security is watching!

5. Stay Focused And Stay Calm

Last but not least, stay focused and stay calm while playing casino cards games. It's easy to get carried away and start making rash decisions when there's money on the line - but if you keep these five tips in mind, you'll be jumping higher for those coveted ten-point cards in no time!
