#  Illinois raking in the dough from gambling taxes 

The state of Illinois is enjoying a healthy infusion of cash from gambling taxes, with revenues up more than 20% in the last fiscal year. 

This is good news for a state that is facing significant financial challenges, including an $11 billion budget deficit. Gambling taxes accounted for nearly $800 million of the state’s total revenue in the last fiscal year. 

There are several reasons for the increase in gambling tax revenue. One is the legalization of online gambling in Illinois in 2017. This has allowed the state to collect taxes on bets made by people within its borders. 

Another reason is the growth of casino gambling around the country. This has led to more people visiting casinos in Illinois, and increased spending by those who do. The popularity of slot machines and other electronic forms of gaming has also helped boost tax revenue. 

While the increase in gambling tax revenue is welcome news for Illinois, it is also a sign of a larger problem. Namely, that many people are turning to gambling as a way to solve their financial problems. This can be addictive and harmful, both to individuals and to society as a whole. 

Hopefully, the money generated from gambling taxes will be put to good use, such as helping to reduce the state’s budget deficit or funding important social programs.

#  Illinois sees big revenue from gambling taxes 

Illinois expected to see $1 billion in revenue from gambling taxes in the upcoming fiscal year, officials said. The money is generated from taxes on casinos, racetracks and lottery ticket sales.

Gambling has been a part of Illinois culture for years, with Chicago being home to some of the country's top casinos. But with new casinos popping up around the state, the amount of tax revenue being generated has exploded.

In addition to the money generated by taxes, the gambling industry employs thousands of people in Illinois. With a healthy gaming industry and robust tax revenue, it looks like Illinois is here to stay as a gambling powerhouse.

#  Illinois rakes in $1.4 billion from gambling taxes 

In the fiscal year of 2018, Illinois collected a total of $1.4 billion from gambling taxes. This is a drastic increase from the collections in previous years, where the state only brought in $800 million from gambling taxes. The main reason for this increase is the legalization of sports betting in Illinois in 2019.

Prior to the legalization of sports betting, Illinois collected taxes from casinos, lottery, and horseracing. The state earned $330 million from casino taxes, $720 million from lottery taxes, and $220 million from horseracing taxes in 2018. With the addition of sports betting, these numbers are expected to grow significantly in the coming years.

As a result of this new revenue stream, Illinois has been able to reduce its budget deficit and make important investments in infrastructure and education. In particular, the state has been able to fund new road projects, invest in early childhood education programs, and reduce college tuition costs.

Illinois is not the only state that has seen an increase in gambling tax revenue following the legalization of sports betting. Other states that have legalized sports betting in 2019 include New Jersey, West Virginia, and Mississippi. These states are expected to see a similar increase in tax revenue in the coming years.

The growth of gambling tax revenue offers an opportunity for states to invest more money back into their communities. By legalizing sports betting and investing the proceeds back into important programs like education and infrastructure, states can improve the quality of life for their residents.

#  Illinois' gambling tax revenue up 7 percent 

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Illinois' gambling tax revenue was up more than 7 percent in the fiscal year that ended in June.

The (Springfield) State Journal-Register reports Monday that the state netted nearly $330 million in taxes from casinos, racetracks and video poker. That's up from about $310 million the previous year.

The Illinois Gaming Board attributes the growth to increased winnings at casinos and racetracks.

Gambling tax revenue is a key source of money for the state's capital budget. About a third of the money goes to pay for construction projects, including a $4 billion capital program approved by lawmakers this year.

#  Illinois' gambling revenue hits all-time high

The Illinois Gaming Board announced Friday that the state’s gambling industry took in a record $1.47 billion in revenue last year, up from $1.29 billion in 2016.

Gaming board spokesman Gene O’Shea said casino tax revenues totaled $257 million in 2017, up from the previous high of $239 million in 2016. Slot machine tax revenues were up 3 percent to $815 million and table game tax revenues were up 5 percent to $203 million.

Taxes on video poker and other games were down 3 percent to $119 million.

The biggest increase was at the Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, which took in $421.5 million in 2017, up from $371 million the year before. The casino is owned by Rockford, Illinois-based Rush Street Gaming.

Casinos in Aurora, Joliet, East St. Louis and Springfield also had revenue increases. The only casino with a revenue decrease was Harrah’s Joliet, which took in $211 million last year compared to $236 million in 2016.

O’Shea said the increase is attributable to the addition of new casinos and expansions at existing casinos over the past few years. He also said that 2017 was a good year for tourism nationally and statewide, which helped boost casino revenues.
