#  Making Slot Device Cake - Learn How To Create This Fun Party Centerpiece

Making a slot machine cake is really easy, and it will make your next party one that everyone will be talking about. With just a few simple ingredients, you can create an impressive cake centerpiece that looks like the real thing.

To get started, you'll need: 

- Two 9 inch round cakes 
- 1 can of white frosting 
- Pink food coloring 
- Brown food coloring 
- A bowl of small pretzels 
- 1 bag of chocolate chips 
- Toothpicks 
- And a Slot Machine Cake Template (you can find this online or in most cake decorating stores)

1. Start by baking your two 9 inch round cakes. Once they're cool, use a serrated knife to level them off so they are both the same height. Then, using a large offset spatula, frost one of the cakes with white frosting. You can add pink food coloring to the frosting for a more realistic looking slot machine cake, but this is optional. I used about 5 drops of pink food coloring to get the desired color.
2. Place the second cake on top of the first one, and then use a toothpick to mark 8 evenly spaced points around the edge of the cake. These will be your guide for placing the pretzels later on.
3. Now take your chocolate chips and place them in a bowl. Microwave them in 30 second intervals until they are melted and smooth. Use a spoon to drizzle the chocolate over the top of the cake, making sure to fill in between the toothpick marks that you made earlier. Be careful not to let any chocolate drip down the sides of the cake or it will be difficult to coat them in pretzels later on. 
4. Once all of the chocolate has been poured over top, take your pretzels and start sticking them into the cake at each of the 8 points that you marked earlier. Don't worry if some break or crumble – that's perfectly normal! Just make sure that there are enough pretzels sticking out so that when it's time to serve, people can easily pick up a slice of cake without getting chocolate all over their hands.
