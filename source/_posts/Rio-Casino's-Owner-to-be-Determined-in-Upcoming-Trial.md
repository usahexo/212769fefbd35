#  Rio Casino's Owner to be Determined in Upcoming Trial

The owner of Rio Casino in Las Vegas will be determined in an upcoming trial. The casino is currently in receivership, and a decision on its future will hinge on the court's findings.

The owner of the casino, Jay Itkowitz, is facing multiple felony charges, including theft and fraud. Prosecutors allege that he stole over $1 million from the casino. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison.

Itkowitz has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to fight the charges. He has blamed the casino's financial troubles on the recession and poor management decisions by previous owners.

Rio Casino has been in receivership since 2009, when Itkowitz failed to make a loan payment. The casino has since been sold to a new owner, but the future of it remains uncertain.

The trial is expected to begin in March.

#  Judge Orders Rio Casino Sold to repay Debt

Rio Casino, which is located in Las Vegas, has been ordered to be put up for sale by a federal bankruptcy judge in order to repay its $1 billion debt. This marks the latest development in the casino’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.

The casino, which is owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation, will now have to go through a bidding process in order to find a buyer who is willing to take on its debt. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection back in January after it failed to reach an agreement with its creditors.

Rio Casino is not the only Caesars property that is facing financial troubles. The company also owns casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Cincinnati, Ohio. However, the Rio Casino is the only one of Caesars’ properties that is located outside of these states.

Caesars Entertainment Corporation was founded back in 1970 and has since become one of the largest gaming companies in the world. The company owns or operates 47 casinos and resorts around the globe. In addition to its casino properties, Caesars also owns the largest chain of hotels in Las Vegas.

The financial problems at Rio Casino come as no surprise to industry analysts. The casino has been struggling for quite some time now due to increased competition from other casinos in Las Vegas as well as from online gambling sites.

#  Who Owns the Rio Casino?

The Rio casino is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Las Vegas. Owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corporation, it has been a fixture on the Strip since 1995. But who actually owns the Rio?

Caesars Entertainment Corporation is a publicly traded company with more than 47,000 employees and assets worth more than $24 billion. It is the world's largest casino operator and owns or operates more than 50 casinos around the world.

The Rio is one of six casinos owned and operated by Caesars in Las Vegas. Other famous properties include Caesars Palace, The Linq, The Cromwell, Bally's and Paris. In addition to its casino operations, Caesars also owns the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino, Harrah's New Orleans Hotel and Casino, and Harvey's Lake Tahoe Resort and Casino.

Caesars Entertainment Corporation is a subsidiary of Caesars Acquisition Company (CAC), which is a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company Inc. (CEOC). CEOC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015, listing $18 billion in liabilities.

In February 2017, a group led by billionaire Tilman Fertitta agreed to buy CEOC for $5.1 billion. Fertitta already owns the Golden Nugget casino chain, so the Rio will become part of his empire once the deal closes.

#  Bankruptcy Court Sells Rio Casino to Pay Creditors

The U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of Rio Casino to pay creditors on Monday. The $362 million sale will be divided among the casino’s creditors, including its two largest lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG.

The casino, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, considered several offers, but the $362 million bid from a group of investors led by Los Angeles-based investment firm Colony Capital LLC was the highest.

Rio Casino’s parent company, Tropicana Entertainment Inc., is also in bankruptcy and is being sold to a group led by Lawrence Ho, son of gambling mogul Stanley Ho. That sale is expected to close in the next few weeks.

The closures of both casinos come as a tough blow to Atlantic City, which has been struggling for years with competition from casinos in neighboring states.

#  Rio Casino Falls into Foreclosure

The Rio Casino in Las Vegas has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after falling into foreclosure earlier this year.

The casino, which is owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation, blames its deteriorating financial conditions on the recession and the slow economy. The company has already laid off 1,000 employees and is looking to sell the casino.

It is unclear whether or not the casino will be able to find a buyer, but if it does, the Rio Casino will become the largest casino to go through bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.
