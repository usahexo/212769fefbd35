#  How to make a slot machine out of cardboard boxes in 5 easy steps 

Slot machines are a popular amusement in casinos all over the world. While they can be quite expensive to play, you can actually make your own slot machine at home with some cardboard boxes and a bit of creativity.

Here is a simple step-by-step guide on how to make your very own cardboard slot machine:

1. Cut two rectangular pieces out of cardboard box for the sides of the machine. These should be big enough to fit comfortably in your hands and should be around 18 inches tall and 12 inches wide. 
2. Cut a smaller rectangular piece out of cardboard for the front of the machine. This should be around 9 inches tall and 6 inches wide. 
3. Cut four thin strips out of cardboard and fold them in half lengthwise. These will be the reels on the slot machine. 
4. Glue or tape the reels to the front piece of cardboard and make sure that they spin freely. 
5. Finally, cut a circular piece out of cardboard for the top of the machine and glue it in place. You can then decorate your machine with stickers, paint or anything else you like!

Making a slot machine out of cardboard boxes is an easy and fun project that can be completed in under an hour. This guide will show you how to make a basic slot machine using cardboard boxes and some basic tools.

You will need:

-Two cardboard boxes
-Scissors
-Tape
- ruler or a straight edge 
-Pencil
-Craft knife 
-Paint or markers (optional)

1. Cut one of the cardboard boxes in half so that you have two identical square pieces.
2. Cut a small rectangular hole in the center of one of the squares. The hole should be big enough for a dollar bill or other currency to fit through but not too big or it will be too easy to win money from the slot machine!
3. Tape the two boxes together so that the square with the hole is on the bottom and the other square is on top.
4. Decorate your slot machine with paint or markers if desired. 
5. Make a stand for your machine out of another piece of cardboard. The stand should be wide enough to support the entire machine and tall enough so that the machine sits at a slightly sloped angle (this will make it easier for players to insert money into the machine). Glue or tape the stand to the bottom of your slot machine. 
6. To play, insert a bill into the hole on the bottom of the machine and pull back on the lever arm.

#  How to make a slot machine out of cardboard boxes that pays out real money 

Slot machines are ubiquitous in casinos and other gambling venues, but they can also be made at home with a few cardboard boxes and some creativity. In this article, we'll show you how to make a slot machine that actually pays out real money (or whatever currency you prefer).

The first thing you'll need is some cardboard boxes. You can use any size boxes, but for our example we'll be using a 16" x 16" x 16" box. You'll also need a ruler or a measuring tape, scissors, a pencil, and some adhesive tape.

The basic idea behind the slot machine is to create three spinning cylinders out of cardboard, each with a different number of slots. The idea is that when you spin the cylinders, the slots will line up and match one of the winning combinations shown on the payout table.

Start by cutting three panels out of the cardboard box using the scissors. These will form the three spinning cylinders for your slot machine. Next, use the ruler or measuring tape to measure and mark 9 evenly-spaced lines on each panel (3 lines per side). These will be the slots that your cylindrical panels will spin through.

Now it's time to start assembling the machine. First, take one of the panels and trim off any excess cardboard so that it's square in shape. Then use adhesive tape to attach it to one end of the second panel (the panel with no slots). Make sure that the two panels are aligned perfectly before taping them together.

Do the same thing with the third panel, but attach it to the opposite end of the second panel so that there is an open gap in between them (see diagram below). This will be where your players insert their money into the machine.

   
Now it's time to start adding some decoration! We used a black marker to draw some simple designs on our machine, but you can get as creative as you like here. Once you're finished, use more adhesive tape to attach all three panels together into one big cylinder.

Finally, cut a small hole in one end of the cylinder and insert a dowel rod or another spare piece of lumber into it. This will be used to spin the cylinders when players press down on it. You're now ready to play your very own homemade slot machine!

#  How to make a slot machine out of cardboard boxes – the ultimate guide 

Slot machines are a popular casino game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. They are also relatively easy to make, so you can enjoy them at home without spending a lot of money. In this article, we will show you how to make a slot machine out of cardboard boxes.

The first step is to gather the necessary materials. You will need some cardboard boxes, a hot glue gun, scissors, tape, and some other basic supplies.

The next step is to cut the boxes into the desired shape. You will need three boxes in total – one for the body of the machine, one for the front panel, and one for the back panel. The body of the machine should be approximately 18 inches wide by 12 inches high by 6 inches deep. The front and back panels should be approximately 6 inches wide by 12 inches high.

Once you have cut the boxes into the appropriate shapes, it is time to start gluing them together. Start with the body of the machine. Glue two sides of the box together so that it forms a tube shape. Then glue the front and back panels to the front and back sides of the tube, making sure that they are properly aligned.

Next, glue the top panel to the top of the tube. Finally, secure all of the edges with tape so that it is firmly glued together.

Now it is time to make the coin slot. Cut a small hole in one end of the body of the machine and insert a piece of thin cardboard or plastic into it. This will be your coin slot.

Finally, it is time to add decoration! You can use stickers, paint, or any other type of decoration to make your slot machine look more like a real casino game. Have fun with it!

Once you have finished decorating your slot machine, it is time to play! Simply put some coins into the coin slot and pull back on the lever to start spinning those reels!

#  How to make a slot machine out of cardboard boxes for your next birthday party

If you're looking for a fun and unique way to celebrate your birthday, why not try making a slot machine out of cardboard boxes? This project is easy to do and can be completed in just a few hours. All you need are some basic supplies and a little bit of creativity!

To get started, you'll need cardboard boxes in various shapes and sizes. For the body of the slot machine, use a large box that's at least 24 inches wide and 18 inches tall. You'll also need two smaller boxes for the sides of the machine. These boxes should be about 12 inches wide and 6 inches tall.

Next, cut out three circles from the large box using a ruler and a sharp knife or scissors. The circles should be about 8 inches in diameter. Cut out two rectangles from the small boxes using the same measurements. These will be the sides of the machine.

Finally, glue or tape the small boxes to the sides of the large box, making sure that they line up evenly. Then, glue or tape the circles to the top front and back of the machine. Your slot machine is now complete!

To use your new toy, insert a coin into one of the slots on the front of the machine. Then, pull down on one of the levers on either side to spin the reels. If you're lucky, you may just win a prize!
