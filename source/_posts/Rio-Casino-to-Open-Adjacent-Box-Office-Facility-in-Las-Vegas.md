#  Rio Casino to Open Adjacent Box Office Facility in Las Vegas

Rio Las Vegas, known for its iconic “Samba” tower, is expanding its entertainment options by opening a new adjacent box office facility. The standalone building will be located on the casino’s property and offer ticketing services for events taking place at Rio and other venues in the city.

Box office facilities are common among casinos in Las Vegas, but Rio’s new addition will be unique in that it will only sell tickets for shows at Rio and other properties owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation – the company that owns Rio Las Vegas. This means that customers who visit the facility will be able to purchase tickets to events at any of Caesars Entertainment’s Las Vegas venues, including The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, The LINQ Promenade and Harrah’s Las Vegas.

The new box office facility is expected to open in the spring of 2018. In addition to ticketing services, it will also offer customer assistance, merchandise sales and event information.
