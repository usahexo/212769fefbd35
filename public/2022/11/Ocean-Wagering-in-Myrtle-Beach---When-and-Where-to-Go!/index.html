<ol>
<li><p>Decide what you want to do while you’re there. Myrtle Beach offers plenty of activities for visitors of all ages, so be sure to pick out a few things you’d like to do before you go. This will help narrow down your choices when it comes time to book your hotel or choose where to eat.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Bring sunscreen and insect repellent. The Carolina sun can be brutal, and the mosquitoes can be pesky, so don’t forget these essentials!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pack light. Myrtle Beach is a very walkable city, so there’s no need to bring along a lot of heavy luggage. A swimsuit, some shorts and t-shirts, sandals, and sunscreen should be more than enough.</p>

<p>Early fall is a great time to visit Myrtle Beach, as the weather is still warm and sunny but the crowds haven’t quite arrived yet. That means you’ll have plenty of space on the beach to stake out your spot and lay down some bets.</p>
<p>Just because the weather is nice doesn’t mean that the action stops though. There are plenty of great places to gamble at Myrtle Beach, whether you’re looking for a traditional casino or a more exotic experience.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a classic casino gambling experience, then head to The Palace at Broadway at the Beach. This large complex has everything from slot machines and blackjack tables to poker tournaments and high-stakes baccarat games. There’s something for everyone at The Palace, and you can easily lose track of time while you’re there!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something a bit more unique, then why not try betting on some sea creatures? The Ripley’s Aquarium has a “Believe it or Not” Odditorium that houses a variety of different fish and marine life. You can place bets on which species will win various swimming races, or even bet on how long a particular fish can survive out of water!</p>
<p>No matter what type of gambling you’re into, Myrtle Beach is sure to have something to offer. So put on your sunscreen and get ready for some thrilling autumn seaside wagering!</p>
