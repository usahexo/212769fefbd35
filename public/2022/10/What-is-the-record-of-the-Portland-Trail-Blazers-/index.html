      		<h1 id="What-is-the-record-of-the-Portland-Trail-Blazers"><a href="#What-is-the-record-of-the-Portland-Trail-Blazers" class="headerlink" title="What is the record of the Portland Trail Blazers?"></a>What is the record of the Portland Trail Blazers?</h1><p>The Portland Trail Blazers are a professional basketball team based in Portland, Oregon. The team competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league’s Western Conference Northwest Division. The franchise was founded in 1970, and played its home games at the Memorial Coliseum until 1995. The Blazers have made the playoffs 24 times, reached the conference finals six times, and advanced to the NBA Finals twice, winning the championship in 1977.</p>
<p>In 1970,nw entrepreneur Harry Glickman sought to bring an NBA franchise to Portland and met with then-commissioner Walter Kennedy. Upon finding that no other team was available, Kennedy awarded Glickman an expansion franchise on March 16,1970. One week later, on March 23,1970, the NBA awarded a second expansion franchise to Seattle resident Sam Schulman. Thus, with the addition of the Blazers and SuperSonics (now Oklahoma City Thunder),the 1970–71 season began with four expansion teams.</p>
<p>The immediate years were lean for both clubs; each posted losing records in their inaugural seasons. The 76-78 Sonics would eventually make it to their first playoff berth but lost in three straight games to eventual champions Washington Bullets; The 77-79 Blazers did not fair much better as they only notched 20 wins total between both seasons combined and finished dead last 4 out of 4 western divisional teams their first two years.  In spite of these struggles however it was during these early years that Portland cemented its reputation as one of America’s most rabid sports towns - attendance for Blazer games during this time routinely ranked among top 5 nationwide regardless of sport or league affiliation (factoring in NFL American football games at nearby Civic Stadium). It was also around this time that pop-culture icons Peanuts cartoonist Charles Schultz and Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter penned odes honoring each respective hometown squad - Schultz’ “I Like Basketball” being perhaps most famous&#x2F;notorious sporting anthem ever written about any city’s team. </p>
<p>Slowly but surely however things began to turnaround for both franchises - by 1980-81 season Sonics had become playoff regulars while Blazers had improved enough to make it into 2nd round where they would take eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers 7 full games before finally succumbing; 1982-83 would see Seattle finally advance to Western Conference Finals where they would lose again in 5 games vs Lakers. Portland on other hand underwent a dramatic rebranding under new head coach Mike Schuler which saw flashy red &amp; black uniforms &amp; playstyle which energized fan base; 1986 playoffs would be when this all came together as they surprisingly defeated 3rd seed Dallas Mavericks en route to their first (and only) trip to NBA Finals where they eventually lost against Boston Celtics 4-0).  Since then the two franchises fortunes have continued diverge with Blazers missing playoffs throughout 90s while Sonics became perennial contenders reaching West Finals 3 times between 95-2004 era before relocating&#x2F;rebranding as Oklahoma City Thunder post 2008 financial crisis. In spite of this one could argue that today’s Blazer fanbase is even more rabid than ever before due largely to revival of successful team over past several seasons after decades long down period - culminating in recent 2017 trip the Conference Finals .</p>

They were the first NBA team to win three consecutive championships (1956-1958), and they are also the only team in NBA history to win a championship in three consecutive cities (Boston, Minneapolis, Los Angeles).</p>

The team was founded in 1970 as an expansion team and has enjoyed a good deal of success over the years. Some of the most famous players to have played for the Blazers include Jerome Kersey, Clyde Drexler, Buck Williams, and Terry Porter.</p>
<p>Jerome Kersey was drafted by the Blazers in 1984 and spent 11 seasons with the team. He was a two-time All-Star and helped lead the Blazers to the NBA Finals in 1990. Clyde Drexler was drafted by Portland in 1983 and played for the Blazers for 10 seasons. He was a five-time All-Star and won an Olympic gold medal with Team USA in 1992.
