      		<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch’s-Soft-14-Hand-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch’s-Soft-14-Hand-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch’s Soft 14 Hand in Blackjack"></a>Rupert Murdoch’s Soft 14 Hand in Blackjack</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch is a business magnate, investor, and media mogul. In his early days, he created a small newspaper in Adelaide, Australia. He has since expanded his empire to include the Fox broadcasting network, Sky News, The Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins book publishing, and much more.</p>
<p>Murdoch is known for his conservative views and strong belief in free market capitalism. As one of the richest and most powerful men in the world, he has been both praised and criticised for his influence on media and politics.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll take a look at some of Murdoch’s business deals and explore how he became one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history.</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch was born in Melbourne, Australia on March 11th, 1931. After dropping out of law school, Murdoch started his first business venture by purchasing a small paper in Adelaide. He quickly grew his empire by acquiring other newspapers and broadcasting networks.</p>
<p>Murdoch is a staunch advocate of free market capitalism and has spoken out against government regulation of the media industry. He is also a strong supporter of the Republican Party in the United States.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Murdoch has been involved in many high-profile business deals. In 1985, he purchased 20th Century Fox for $US 2 billion. A few years later, he merged 20th Century Fox with News Corporation – creating one of the largest media empires in the world.</p>
<p>In 2007, News Corporation made a takeover bid for Dow Jones &amp; Company – the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The bid was unsuccessful, but Murdoch later bought Dow Jones outright by purchasing its parent company – British Sky Broadcasting Group (BSkyB).</p>
<p>In 2013, BSkyB was investigated by UK authorities for bribery and corruption offences. Murdoch was subsequently forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB. However, he retains control of News Corporation’s broadcasting interests through his family trusts.</p>
<p>Today, Rupert Murdoch is worth an estimated $US13 billion and is considered one of the most influential businessmen in the world. He has been honoured with numerous awards including Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters from France and The Orson Welles Award from the American Film Institute.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch-Bets-on-Soft-14-Hand-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch-Bets-on-Soft-14-Hand-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch Bets on Soft 14 Hand in Blackjack"></a>Rupert Murdoch Bets on Soft 14 Hand in Blackjack</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch, owner of News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, recently wagered a cool $10 million on a hand of blackjack at the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas. The 84-year-old billionaire hit a lucky streak and won $11.7 million, doubling his initial investment.</p>
<p>Murdoch is no stranger to high-stakes gambling; he once lost nearly $1 billion in a single year playing poker. But this latest win is a sign that he may be getting back on his feet after several recent setbacks. In 2013, News Corp was forced to sell its subsidiary Myspace for just $35 million, and 21st Century Fox has seen its stock prices plummet in the past year.</p>
<p>Still, Murdoch seems to have no problem parting with his money when the mood strikes him. “I enjoy the excitement,” he said in an interview in 2012. “I’m not one of these people who sit at home and worry about it.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear what Murdoch plans to do with his latest windfall, but one thing’s for sure: he won’t be hurting for cash anytime soon.</p>
<h1 id="Murdoch’s-Soft-14-Hand-pay-out-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Murdoch’s-Soft-14-Hand-pay-out-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Murdoch’s Soft 14 Hand pay out in Blackjack"></a>Murdoch’s Soft 14 Hand pay out in Blackjack</h1><p>Murdoch was dealt a soft 14 hand and he decided to hit. His next card was an Ace, so his hand became a weak 15. Murdoch’s opponent, who had been betting conservatively up to that point, suddenly placed a large bet. Murdoch decided to call the bet, but then his opponent revealed a 10, which meant that Murdoch lost the hand.</p>
<p>Murdoch was disappointed with the outcome of the hand, but he consoled himself with the thought that he had made a good decision by hitting his soft 14. In fact, if Murdoch had stood on his original 14 hand, he would have lost an even larger amount of money.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch’s-lucky-soft-14-hand-in-blackjack"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch’s-lucky-soft-14-hand-in-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch’s lucky soft 14 hand in blackjack"></a>Rupert Murdoch’s lucky soft 14 hand in blackjack</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch has been having a bit of a run of luck recently. His latest win was at the blackjack table, where he managed to get a soft 14 hand.</p>
<p>Murdoch was playing at the Aria casino in Las Vegas when he got dealt two fours and a six. This gave him a total of 14, but because it is considered a ‘soft’ hand - meaning that the player can’t go bust if they hit on another card - Murdoch was able to continue playing.</p>
<p>He eventually doubled down on his fourth card, getting an ace and making his hand worth 21. This won him the game, and left him with a nice little profit.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Murdoch has had some success at the blackjack table. In fact, he is something of a regular at casinos around the world, and often leaves with a healthy profit.</p>
<p>So what is it about blackjack that makes it so appealing to Murdoch? Well, for one thing, it’s a game that can be won or lost very quickly. This means that there is always the potential for big wins or big losses, which can add to the excitement of playing.</p>
<p>Blackjack is also a relatively simple game to learn, and even novices can start winning relatively quickly if they apply some basic strategy. This is another reason why Murdoch enjoys playing blackjack - he knows that he has a good chance of winning even if he doesn’t know all the ins and outs of the game.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems that Rupert Murdoch’s lucky soft 14 hand in blackjack is just another example of his gambling prowess. He may not be able to beat the stock market every time, but when it comes to blackjack he seems to have a knack for coming out on top.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch’s-soft-14-blackjack-hand-wins-big"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch’s-soft-14-blackjack-hand-wins-big" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch’s soft 14 blackjack hand wins big"></a>Rupert Murdoch’s soft 14 blackjack hand wins big</h1><p>Billionaire Rupert Murdoch’s big bet on the 14 black paid off handsomely Thursday, as casino officials confirmed the media mogul walked away with a cool $27.5 million after his soft hand won at the craps table.</p>
<p>The 81-year-old Murdoch was playing at the high roller table in the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas when he placed his chips on the 14 black — a move that caused other players to back away from the table.</p>
<p>After a series of rolls, Murdoch’s hand held up and he was rewarded with a payout that dwarfs his recent purchase of 21st Century Fox for $52 billion.</p>
<p>Murdoch could not be reached for comment, but sources close to him say he is already plotting his next move at the craps table.</p>
