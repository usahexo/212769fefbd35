This year, he put his money on the Cleveland Cavaliers, and despite their Game 1 loss to the Golden State Warriors, he’s still celebrating after they mounted a comeback to win the series in seven games.</p>
<p>Pol said he was confident about the Cavs’ chances all along, even when they were down three games to one.</p>
<p>“It was clear that LeBron James was not going to let his team lose,” Pol said.</p>
<p>James averaged a triple double for the series and was named Finals MVP.</p>
<p>Pol has been playing poker professionally since 2007 and has won millions of dollars in tournaments worldwide. In addition to his love of gambling on sports, he is also a fan of blackjack and roulette.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Bettor-Guides-New-Caledonia-to-Victory-in-Online-Poker"><a href="#Sports-Bettor-Guides-New-Caledonia-to-Victory-in-Online-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Sports Bettor Guides New Caledonia to Victory in Online Poker"></a>Sports Bettor Guides New Caledonia to Victory in Online Poker</h1><p>When the chips are down, it’s time to bring out the big guns. For New Caledonia’s online poker team, that meant turning to their sports bettor for guidance.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves. In a matchup against Sweden, the New Caledonians pulled off an improbable victory, thanks in no small part to their sports bettor’s keen insights.</p>
<p>According to reports, the team was down by nearly $2,000 with just two players remaining. But with some expert advice from their sports bettor, they were able to mount a comeback and take home the win.</p>
<p>So what can aspiring poker players learn from this success story? Here are three tips from the New Caledonia team that can help you take your game to the next level:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know your opponent inside and out</li>
</ol>
<p>In any poker matchup, it’s essential to have a good understanding of your opponent’s playing style. If you can anticipate their moves, you’ll be in a much better position to make successful bets yourself.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Stay calm under pressure</li>
</ol>
<p>Poker is a game of nerves as well as strategy. When the pressure is on, it’s important not to let emotions get the best of you. Keep your head cool and stick to your game plan, no matter what obstacles lie in your way.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Have faith in your team members</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if you’re playing solo poker, it’s important to trust your team members implicitly. When everyone is working toward the same goal, great things can happen. So don’t be afraid to put your trust in your fellow players – they may just surprise you when it matters most.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Pro’s-Knowledge-of-NBA-Playoffs-Pays-Off"><a href="#Poker-Pro’s-Knowledge-of-NBA-Playoffs-Pays-Off" class="headerlink" title="Poker Pro’s Knowledge of NBA Playoffs Pays Off"></a>Poker Pro’s Knowledge of NBA Playoffs Pays Off</h1><p>The NBA playoffs are in full swing and a number of the world’s best poker players are cashing in on their sports knowledge.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors have been the top team in the league all season long but they were pushed to the brink by the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. Poker pro Antonio Esfandiari was one of the many who correctly picked the Rockets to upset the Warriors.</p>
<p>Esfandiari is a big basketball fan and he’s not afraid to put his money where his mouth is. He told reporters that he has wagered on games throughout the playoffs and he’s already up over $100,000.</p>
<p>Other poker pros who have cashed in on their basketball knowledge include Phil Ivey, Dan Bilzerian and Jason Koon. Ivey is a huge LeBron James fan and he predicted that James would take down the Eastern Conference Finals with ease.</p>
<p>Bilzerian is a Lakers fan and he wagered on them to reach the Finals. The Lakers fell short but Bilzerian still made a small profit thanks to some early round upsets. Koon is a Rockets fan and he also cashed in on some favourable odds by betting on Houston throughout the playoffs.</p>
<p>It’s not just poker pros who are winning money off their sports knowledge either. Plenty of everyday sports fans have been banking profits thanks to their understanding of basketball betting lines.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors may have been favourites going into the playoffs but there were plenty of good value bets available on other teams. The Rockets, for example, were available at insane odds of +650 early in their series against Golden State.</p>
<p>Houston ended up upsetting the Warriors in seven games and anyone who bet on them was duly rewarded. There were plenty of other good value bets available throughout the playoffs and those who took advantage of them have likely made a tidy profit.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Bettor-Has-Successful-Night-with-NBA-Picks"><a href="#Online-Bettor-Has-Successful-Night-with-NBA-Picks" class="headerlink" title="Online Bettor Has Successful Night with NBA Picks"></a>Online Bettor Has Successful Night with NBA Picks</h1><p>As the NBA season moves into its playoff race, online bettors are turning their attention to making some money off the games.  One such bettor, LuckyDime, had a successful night on Wednesday by correctly predicting eight out of nine games. </p>
<p>LuckyDime has been sharp with his picks all year long and entered Wednesday night with a record of 214-158-16 overall. He nailed his locks of the night in the Warriors -7 over Timberwolves and Rockets -9 over Suns, cashing in on both bets. </p>
<p>With the NBA playoffs just around the corner, LuckyDime will be looking to keep his hot streak going and pad his bankroll in the process. Make sure to follow his picks closely as the action heats up down the stretch!</p>
<h1 id="New-Caledonia-Poker-Star-Wins-Big-by-Betting-on-Basketball"><a href="#New-Caledonia-Poker-Star-Wins-Big-by-Betting-on-Basketball" class="headerlink" title="New Caledonia Poker Star Wins Big by Betting on Basketball"></a>New Caledonia Poker Star Wins Big by Betting on Basketball</h1><p>Instead of playing poker at the casino as he often does, 23-year-old Cédric Decoudun decided to put his money on a different game—basketball. He wagered a total of $1,000 on four different games, and came out a big winner with a return of over $5,000!</p>
<p>The young man from Noumea in New Caledonia is not new to wagering; he often bets small amounts on soccer games. But this time, he decided to go all in and bet significantly more on basketball matches. And it certainly paid off!</p>
<p>One of the biggest wins came when he wagered $100 on the Detroit Pistons to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder. Not only did Detroit win, but they did so by a margin of 22 points, making Decoudun’s payout an impressive $1,000!</p>
<p>He was also successful with smaller wagers, such as betting $10 on the Miami Heat to beat the Milwaukee Bucks and winning back $100. In all, Decoudun walked away from the basketball games with a tidy profit—and some excited friends who are now eager to follow in his footsteps!</p>
